# Module 1: DNA sequencing, strings and matching

This module we begin our exploration of algorithms for analyzing DNA sequencing data. We'll discuss DNA sequencing technology, its past and present, and how it works.

Why study this? DNA sequencers and how they work. How DNA can be represented as a string. Using Python to parse and manipulate real genome sequences and real DNA sequencing data.  Naive exact matching.


## Important topics of this Module:

* Second-generation sequencers
* Sequencing errors and base qualities
* Sequencing reads
* FASTA and FASTQ formats
* Read alignment algorithms
* Naive exact matching algorithm

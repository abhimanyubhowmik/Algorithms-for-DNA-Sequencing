# Module 2: Preprocessing, indexing and approximate matching

In this module, we learn useful and flexible new algorithms for solving the exact and approximate matching problems. We'll start by learning Boyer-Moore, a fast and very widely used algorithm for exact matching

Improving on naive exact matching with Boyer-Moore.  Preprocessing and indexing.  Indexing: grouping and ordering.  k-mers and k-mer indexes.  Approximate matching and the pigeonhole principle.


## Important topics of this Module:

* Bad Character and Good Suffix Rule
* Boyer Moore's Algorithm
* k-mer and subsequence indexes
* Suffix indexes
* Hamming Distances
* Levenshtein/ Edit Distances
